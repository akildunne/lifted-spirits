# Project Overview

## Lifted Spirits

## Project Description

Lifted spirits is a mood tracking app created to help the user become more aware of their everyday triggers. Each day, the user signs into the app and records what they are feeling that day and what activities took place. The app records that information so the user can look back and find patters with mood related to activities and any other notes they log about each day. 

## API and Data Sample

## Timeframes

I plan to work on functionality as quickly as possible to make sure I am able to meet my MVPs early. I would like to take more time to style this app to make sure all three screen layouts are how they should be. Given that this is a mood tracker, I want the user to have their mood instantly brightened just by looking at the app.
